I built a Sales Report & Behaviour Analysis Dashboard in Power BI that dives deep into:

Gender-wise purchasing trends
Frequency of purchases (Male vs Female)
Subscription status by age group
Promo code engagement & discount impact
Preferred payment methods & shipping types
Seasonal buying habits across product categories

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:
âœ… 73% of customers are loyal subscribers
âœ… 18â€“30 age group leads subscriptions
âœ… Clothing & Accessories get the most discount traction
âœ… PayPal, Credit Card, and Cash are top payment methods
âœ… Weekly and Monthly purchases dominate
âœ… Spring and Winter are hot for shopping, but each season tells its own story!

With an average purchase value of $60 and review rating of 3.75, the data reveals golden insights that can guide targeted marketing, inventory, and customer engagement strategies.

This dashboard not only sharpens data storytelling but showcases how Power BI transforms raw numbers into strategic decisions.
